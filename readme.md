**About the project**<br>

I used WEBSTORE to build the project.<br>
Some of the code was built automatically using WEBSTORE.<br>

The application Uses Express to make HTTP requests , EJS to template engine and BOOTSTRAP for style .<br>

The data is saved in a JSON list.

I assumed that DB.JSON exists and therefore must have either data or [].<br>

The app was uploaded to HEROKU , A link to the app is attached above .<br>
